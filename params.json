The process included defining the main users, their goals, collecting the content and customising the CSS of existing theme. In addition I configured automated backups for a Dropbox account and payed attention to SEO.\r\n![Websites of Kantvikin Tulentekijat ry](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MasaSip/masasip.github.io/master/images/KaTu.jpeg)\r\n\r\n### User interfaces and usability\r\nAt this course we learned about user centered design process and applied the knowledge in a group work. Our group choose [Aalto Sharetribe.](https://aalto.sharetribe.com) We evaluated the usability of the service using Nielsen’s heuristics, interviewed four users of the service and finally created a new feature, advanced search with notifications, to fulfil the goals of the users. The new feature was demonstrated using storyboards and Lo-Fi prototypes.\r\n![A Storyboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MasaSip/masasip.github.io/master/images/storyboard.jpeg)\r\n\r\n### Web development and digital media\r\nDuring Studio 2 course I learned about HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Photoshop. We created a visual campaign with poster, website and game for consolidation of municipalities.\r\n![A web development project](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MasaSip/masasip.github.io/master/images/studio2.jpeg)\r\n\r\n### Java project - A 2D platform game\r\nThis project was the final exercise at Studio 1 programming course for freshmen. The beginning was development of ideas, after that choosing Slick2D library to use and planning the MVC architecture of the game. During the project I learned about software development, working independently and using external libraries. The visuals used in the game are drawn by Sonja Kiiveri\r\n![A 2D platform game](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MasaSip/masasip.github.io/master/images/Hamis.jpeg)\r\n","google":"UA-73311542-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
